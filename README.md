# Top three favourite novels review using React + Vite + TailwindCSS

getting a hang of **React**, **Vite**, and **TailwindCSS** by creating something, i love writing and talking about.

## About the Project

This project is a simple frontend application,consisting of reviews of three novels Iâ€™ve read and really loved. here I got to apply the concepts I learned, such as:
- Setting up a React app with **Vite** for faster development, using React hooks(useState, useEffect). 
  - [React Docs]- (https://react.dev/),
  - [Vite Guide]- (https://vitejs.dev/guide/).
  
- To familiarize myself with **TailwindCSS** for utility-first styling.
  - [TailwindCSS Docs]- (https://tailwindcss.com/docs).
  
- acquiring basic understanding of the sturucture of Projects and Organizing components for scalability
